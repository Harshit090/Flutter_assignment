Hello, Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to work with you.
I have made both the screens that were told to build to the best of my capabilities.
I have not used network images but they are within the project folder in 'assets', so there should be no problem.

To run the app the best way would be to run on a virtual device or any mobile phone as I have made it with keeping it in mind.
The device I used to test was 'Samsung Galaxy Note10+', other devices would not give any problem but orientation might differ.
I had tried to keep everything to be not dependent on device screen resolutions but I was not able to provide dynamic resolution adjustment.

I have also attached screenshots from my device of the running app. for cross-reference.
